			<h3>What To Practice/Learn</h3>
			<p>
			Giving visitors too much or too little information could be difference between a lot or a few page its, and in the case of eCommerce, a lot or a loss in sales.
			The idea is to separate content and let the user digest it, without giving too much information or too little. That way, they don't feel overwhelmed or deterred. Having tiles allows chunks of data to be displayed to a user, insead of a long paragraph.
			The goal is to accomplish the creation of these tiles and be able to utilize this concept with any website design using a multitude of different themes, colors, and icons.

			<h3>Relation to the Website Development/Design Field</h3>
			<p>
				As a web developer/designer, the goal is to get a steady flow of customers/visitors. Having too much text to read on a single page without proper whitespace and content separation means you could lose business, or worse, lose money.
				Separating content is extremely important to get recurring visitors or sales on a website. Your content directly drives users--remember that!

			<h3>Relation to the Website Development/Design Field</h3>
			<p>
			Keeping content organized and sorted is very important to having an easy-to-navigate web page. Web pages thare are too clunky and cluttered won't get that many visitors. And with new design standards such as Google's Material Design, designers have a better idea than ever on how to design effective pages and apps!

			<h3>What To Practice/Learn</h3>
			<p>
			Making an easy-to-navigate site requires a good navigation bar. The concept is to create a navbar that helps users reach the most important pages of the site as fast as possible. Key things to keep in mind is the transitions and effects one uses on a navbar; remember that it's supposed to be a smooth and effecient way to traverse a web site. It can't be too bulky, and the effects can't be too slow.
