				With XBit brand products, you can save up to 10% more than what you would with your typical name brand products.
				XBit prioritizes what matters most in a product, and connects with the right suppliers to get a product that you can afford.
				In no way are XBit products meant to be flagship products, unless noted otherwise.
				Our goal is to just get you the most bang for your buck.
