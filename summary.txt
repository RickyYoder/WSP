Summary:

Throughout the course of the month I created 5 web components that I thought were key in modern web design.
I frequently updated the homepage until I was satisfied with the look, and created the 5 components from scratch.
If I came across any road blocks, I would reference sites like CSS-Tricks and StackOverflow to find the answer to my questions.
By completing these components, I've refined my skills as an independent developer.

Postmortem:
I struggled with making my components built from scratch look like what I was attempting to immitate.
To solve this, I simply inspected the source code of the component(s) I struggled with, and digested the CSS.
One thing I can do better is proper quality checking to make sure I have no broken links/buttons on my final result, as I can't let things slide for a professional project.
I did very well in staying focused this month and gaining more experience than what I've ever had before. 
This month allowed me to reflect on my skills, and have dedicated time to refine them.
